Speaker 0    01:42    Thank you for calling Apple. It's plumbing, heating and electric. This is Rochelle. How will we help you today?   Speaker 1    01:48    A hot water tank seems to have a leak in it, so I guess we need to replace that.   Speaker 0    01:55    And where? Where's it leaking from? Is it we can from the top or bottom?   Speaker 1    01:58    Yeah, because from the top? Yeah.   Speaker 0    02:02    And how long has that been going on for?   Speaker 1    02:05    I just noticed it yesterday. I think it probably started recently.   Speaker 0    02:08    Okay. And is it just like a small drip or how would you describe that? Okay. Okay. Well let's see what we can do here for you. What is your address?   Speaker 1    02:22    12 seven 75 West Bellevue Avenue. <inaudible>.   Speaker 0    02:33    All right, let me just pull up your information here.   Speaker 1    02:37    They were thinking about maybe it's the options of either replacing that take water heater or giving you a tankless one. Okay.   Speaker 0    02:55    And is this just a like a normal standalone water heater? Not connected to the boiler at all.   Speaker 1    03:02    That's correct.   Speaker 0    03:05    And about how old is the water heater? Do you know?   Speaker 1    03:08    It's in yours.   Speaker 0    03:11    And is that in the basement or where is it located?   Speaker 1    03:14    Yes, it's in the basement.   Speaker 0    03:15    Basement. Okay. All right. Well yeah, let's definitely see what we can do here for you. So of course we'll get one of our licensed plumbers out to take a look and see what's going on with that water heater. And of course go over options as well as exact pricing for work that can be done. Of course with your approval, they do come most fully stock trucks so they can take care of work right away. Uh, we do just have that $29 service call fee that gets our technician to your home and that is of course waived upon completion of any work. And our technicians do take payment at the time of service. Do you know if you'll be paying cash check or credit for that?   Speaker 1    03:52    They'd probably be a credit card.   Speaker 0    03:55    And when are you available to have someone out?   Speaker 1    03:58    Uh, we're here all the time. So whenever they can come out, that would be great.   Speaker 0    04:04    Okay. Let me just take a look here.   Speaker 1    04:07    <inaudible>   Speaker 0    04:15    and were you like, were you available tomorrow or are you looking more for today?   Speaker 1    04:22    Um, so are we good at repeat after your OB? <inaudible>   Speaker 0    04:34    all right. Uh, so what I can do is I can definitely get your information over to our dispatch, um, and then they'd be able to, uh, give you a call and then, um, give you an update on when we'd be able to get one of our technicians out to your home today. They do typically give you a call back, um, within the hour, um, is the best phone number to reach you at the (720) 922-0382.   Speaker 1    05:04    I can also give you a cell phone number (303) 972-8608.   Speaker 0    05:18    Perfect. Well let me go ahead and just get this information on over to them and then we'll definitely be back in touch with you and give you a timeframe for our technician. And then of course, um, looks like we have your email address@hussmanngroupatcs.com. Is that correct? Alright. And we'll also send you that email of the technician who comes up to your home as well, just so you know who to expect. Um, but of course we do have our electricians and our heating and cooling technicians and we are offering our 21 point AC inspection special at $119 at this time. Was anything else that we can help with that, um, for you today. All right, Michael. Well then we'll be back in touch with you here soon. Thank you. Bye bye.
